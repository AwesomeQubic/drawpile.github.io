# NAME

drawpile.github.io - static Drawpile site

# SYNOPSIS

To set up local development, install ruby and bundler, then run `bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle` followed by `bundle install`. You only need to do that once.

Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` for the local server at `http://localhost:4000/`.
